At the time of prediction, each tree is used to come up with a prediction and every outcome is counted as a vote. For example, if you have trained 3 trees with 2 saying a passenger in the test set will survive and 1 says he will not, the passenger will be classified as a survivor. This approach of overtraining trees, but having the majority's vote count as the actual classification decision, avoids overfitting.\n",

Well, you can request the same attribute from your random forest as well and interpret the relevance of the included variables. You might also want to compare the models in some quick and easy way. For this, we can use the .score() method. The .score() method takes the features data and the target vector and computes mean accuracy of your model. You can apply this method to both the forest and individual trees. Remember, this measure should be high but not extreme because that would be a sign of overfitting.\n",
